# How To Make DIY Gesture Control Hovercraft at Home
In this video, I showed you how to make your own hovercraft / hoverboat from materials available at home and cheapest electronic components available online. We used two cheap brushless motors in this Arduino based project. We used the nRF24L01 module for wireless remote communication. I designed a PCB controller myself for the hovercraft controller. The controller has a minimalist design, it fits in the palm of your hand and you can easily control the joystick with the thumb. As always, I chose PCBWay for PCB printing service. If you want to have this controller, you can easily order from the link below. If you are not interested in PCB, you can easily build a controller yourself. </br> </br>
